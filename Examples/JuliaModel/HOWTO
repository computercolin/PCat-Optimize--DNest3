1) Implement your log likelihood in julia_model.jl, as a function
	called log_likelihood that takes a Vector::Float64 as an argument
	and returns a Float64. You should assume that the priors for the
	parameters are independent Uniform(0, 1) distributions. To use
	a different prior, transform the parameters inside
	your log_likelihood function before moving them.

2) You may add other functions to julia_model.jl, for example to load
	a dataset to refer to in your log likelihood.

3) Open the Makefile and make sure the -L option to g++ points to the
	directory on your computer where the Julia shared library (such
	as libjulia.so) is stored. You might also have to configure your
	system so that it searches for libraries here at runtime, e.g.
	by running ldconfig as root.

4) Open main.cpp and edit the first argument to the function
	jl_init_with_image to be the path to the file sys.so associated with
	Julia on your system.

5) Compile by invoking 'make'. Note: only a single thread can be used.
