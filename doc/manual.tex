\section{Introduction}

\dnest~is a C++ implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, a
powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that is primarily
useful for solving Bayesian Inference problems. For information about how the
algorithm works, please see the paper, available as a preprint at the following
URL:

\begin{center}
{\tt http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.238}
\end{center}

If you find \dnest~useful, please feel free to cite the paper.

\section{Installation}
Please note that I have only ever compiled \dnest~on GNU/Linux,
using the GNU C++ compiler ({\tt g++}). However, I expect it to be
straightforward to compile it on any other Unix-like operating system such as Mac
OS X or FreeBSD. It should be possible, albeit probably more tricky,
to compile \dnest~on Microsoft Windows. If you want to try,
the MinGW compiler is
probably your best bet. I'd be interested to hear from anyone who
has tried this. I would also be interested to hear if anyone has
compiled DNest3 with a different compiler, such as the Intel C++
compiler.

\subsection{Dependencies}
\dnest~depends on some other software that you will need to have installed on
your system. These should be quite easy to obtain. I highly
recommend obtaining these programs from your OS's package manager,
rather than installing them from source. Note that some OSs split up
packages into binaries and "development" packages, with a -dev (e.g.
in Debian or Ubuntu) or -devel suffix (e.g. Fedora). You will need
both. Here's a list of dependencies:

\begin{itemize}
\item The GNU Scientific Library
\item Python 2, along with NumPy and matplotlib
\item The thread and system parts of the Boost C++ library.
It may be easier to just install all of Boost.
\end{itemize}

DNest3 uses GSL's random number generator. Python, NumPy and
matplotlib are used for the postprocessing scripts and for
plotting. Boost is used for parallelization (I have not ported \dnest~to
C++11).


%    <h3>Compiling<br>
%    </h3>
%    To compile DNest3, simply run<br>
%    <br>
%    <span style="font-family: monospace;">make</span><br>
%    <br>
%    in the root DNest3 directory. This will create <span
%      style="font-family: monospace;"></span>a static library <span
%      style="font-family: monospace;">libdnest3.a</span> in the current
%    directory. If you like, feel free to copy these to some other
%    location on your system, for example <span style="font-family:
%      monospace;">/usr/local/lib</span>. It will also compile the
%    examples in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Examples/</span>
%    directory, creating executable files called <span
%      style="font-family: monospace;">main</span> that you can use to
%    run the examples.<br>
%    <h3>Running the Examples</h3>
%    Two examples are provided with DNest3. I will now explain how DNest3
%    is used through the first example, <span style="font-style:
%      italic;">SpikeSlab</span>.<br>
%    <h4>Example 1: SpikeSlab</h4>
%    The first example, called <span style="font-style: italic;">SpikeSlab</span>,
%    is the demo problem from our <a
%      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380">paper</a>, and is a slight
%    modification of one of the examples in <a
%href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.5542&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">John










%      Skilling's Nested Sampling Paper</a>. It is a problem with 20
%    unknown parameters, each with a uniform prior between -0.5 and 0.5.
%    The priors for all of the parameters are independent. The likelihood
%    function is a mixture of two Gaussians: one is a wide "slab" and the
%    other is a narrow "spike". The slab is centered at (0, 0, ..., 0)
%    with a width of 0.1 in each dimension. The spike is centered at
%    (0.031, 0.031, ..., 0.031) and has a width of 0.01 in each
%    dimension. This problem is challenging for all sampling algorithms
%    that are not variants of Nested Sampling.<br>
%    <br>
%    To run DNest3 on the <span style="font-style: italic;">SpikeSlab</span>
%    example, simply compile DNest3, then enter the SpikeSlab directory
%    and run <span style="font-family: monospace;">main</span>. <br>
%    <br>
%    <code><span style="font-family: monospace;">make<br>
%        cd Examples/SpikeSlab<br>
%        ./main</span></code><br style="font-family: monospace;">
%    <br>
%    You should see a bunch of output that looks like this:<br>
%    <samp><br>

%    </samp><br>
%    and so on. By default, this process will continue forever (this can
%    be overridden by using different OPTIONS). At some point, you should
%    kill it with Ctrl-C. Then, it is time to examine and process the
%    output. The executable itself creates the following output files:<br>
%    <br style="font-family: monospace;">
%    <span style="font-family: monospace;">levels.txt</span><br
%      style="font-family: monospace;">
%    <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span><br
%      style="font-family: monospace;">
%    <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample_info.txt</span><br
%      style="font-family: monospace;">
%    <br>
%    Of these, <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span>
%    is the most important file, as it contains the samples. Each line
%    corresponds to a sample, a point in the parameter space. However,
%    the samples in <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span>
%    are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> posterior samples.
%    Instead, they are samples from the mixture distribution that DNest3
%    actually explores. To actually get posterior samples, you need to
%    run the post-processing script <span style="font-family:
%      monospace;">showresults.py</span>. This script produces useful
%    plots of the sort shown in the <a
%      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380">paper</a>, and also creates
%    the following additional output files that will probably be of more
%    interest to you:<br>
%    <br>
%    <span style="font-family: monospace;">weights.txt</span><br
%      style="font-family: monospace;">
%    <span style="font-family: monospace;">posterior_sample.txt</span><span
%      style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br style="font-family:
%      monospace;">
%    <br>
%    The file <span style="font-family: monospace;">weights.txt</span>
%    contains importance weights for the samples in <span
%      style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span>. Alternatively,
%    if you are not used to dealing with non-equally-weighted samples,
%    the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">posterior_sample.txt</span>
%    is for you!<br>
%    <br>
%    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Note: You can also run <span
%        style="font-family: monospace;">showresults.py</span> while the
%      main process is still running. In fact, this is recommended in any
%      non-trivial problem for monitoring the algorithm's progress. The
%      only issue is that the main process may write to the output files
%      while <span style="font-family: monospace;">showresults.py</span>
%      is trying to load them. This may case an "ERROR: Size mismatch"
%      message to be displayed. The workaround is to suspend the main
%      process with Ctrl-Z, run <span style="font-family: monospace;">showresults.py</span>
%      and then resume the main process with <span style="font-family:
%        monospace;">fg</span>.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

%    <h3>Other Recommended Samplers</h3>
%    While DNest3 is a very effective sampler and works on a wide range
%    of problems (including many problems with multi-modal posterior
%    distributions or strong correlations), there are a few situations
%    where I would recommend alternative methods. The primary situation
%    in which DNest3 is not recommended is where the calls to the
%    likelihood function are expensive, yet the number of parameters is
%    small to moderate.<br>
%    <br>
%    For these problems, I would recommend <a
%      href="http://github.com/dfm/emcee">emcee</a> in the case where
%    strong correlations may be present but multimodality is unlikely, or
%    <a href="http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/">MultiNest</a>
%    if multimodality is expected or if the value of the evidence
%    integral is required. These samplers also have the advantage of
%    requring less programming from the user. For example, emcee only
%    requires a likelihood function, whereas DNest3 requires that you
%    implement a likelihood function, a function to generate random
%    models from the prior, and a function for generating
%    Metropolis-Hastings proposals.<br>
